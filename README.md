## About The Project
### Brain games include five math games


### Game: "Calculator"
The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown a random mathematical expression, for example 35 + 16, which must be calculated and the correct answer written down.

### Game: "Parity check"
The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown a random number. And he needs to answer yes if the number is even, or no if it is odd.

### Game: "Greatest common divisor"
The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown two random numbers, for example, 25 50. The user must calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.

### Game "Is it a prime number?"
The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown a random number. And he needs to answer yes, if the number is prime, or no, if the number is not prime.

### Game: "Arithmetic progression"
The essence of the game is as follows: we show the user a series of numbers that form an arithmetic progression, replacing any of the numbers with two dots. The player must determine this number.
